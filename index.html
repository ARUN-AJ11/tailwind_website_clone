              can change one's outlook about life. Of late, in Kollywood cinema
              , this pattern can be seen where there is a depressed person(men, mostly)
              who would climb on their Royal Enfield bike and then set off to the
              Himalayan mountains; when they return, they become a refined soul.
              So, is this movie any different from the stereotypical
              portrayal?! Ah, you can't get to the verdict

              but we all know that the couple should still lead their lives on
              (beautiful yet complicated) Earth!! All of us want and yearn for
              a happy, peaceful, fun filled and satisfying married life and a
              partner who would support, defend, and handhold us in this journey.
              But very rarely do we come across couples who have achieved this stature.
              This book 'Row, Row, Row your Boat' is a book written by couple therapists,
              Sophia and Roopak(a couple themselves!!), who turned around their married
              life which was on the verge of collapse with therapy's help. This is a short
              but insightful read on little things that couples could do 'together' to
              reach their vision of becoming a made-for-each-other couple, which apparently
              was their original vow when they got married but may have fizzled out as years passed by.&nbsp; <br>

              poach some information to a competitor firm for some illegal
              commission. Would you be okay doing this so that your appraisal
              sails through, which will also keep you in your manager's good books
              or would you back off as you would be hurting the organization for illegal

              of daily dilemmas that life throws at you with varying complexities.
              This book by Hardayal Singh, a civil service Officer, attempts

            <p class=" pt-4 font-[350]  p-3 ">Hello! Welcome to Sammy's MindChirps. I'm glad
              you are here. To me, the word LIFE is an acronym
              of Laboratory with Infinite Freedom to Experiment.
              It's more like a kaleidoscope offering amazing learning
              opportunities as we grow and explore various facets of life.
              So this blog is a platform where I share anything that I find
              interesting (with my two cents, of course :D). I assure that
              you will have some new learning when you exit the blog. And do
              share your feeback on the blog or anything you want me to write
              about in this blog by dropping an email to mindchirps@gmail.com </p>
